To start working:

1. Create github account.
2. Fork this project (right hand corner). Which will create a copy of this repository in your github account.
3. Install https://git-scm.com/ on your machine.
4. Then run `git clone https://github.com/your github username/ci288` from command line tool. Which will create new folder ci288.
